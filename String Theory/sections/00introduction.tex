\chapter{Introduction}

I shall update the introduction once I have completed more of the course and have a better understanding of what to write here... For now I shall leave you with a nice quote from Dr. David Tong's String Theory course:

\begin{center}
    \textit{
        "Our current understanding of physics, embodied in the standard model, is valid up to energy scales of 103 GeV. This is 15 orders of magnitude away from the Planck scale. Why do we think the time is now ripe to tackle quantum gravity? Surely we are like the ancient Greeks arguing about atomism. Why on earth do we believe that we've developed the right tools to even address the question?\\
        The honest answer, I think, is hubris."
    }
\end{center}
